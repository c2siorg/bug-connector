CVE-2012-6707|WordPress through 4.8.2 uses a weak MD5-based password hashing algorithm, which makes it easier for attackers to determine cleartext values by leveraging access to the hash values. NOTE: the approach to changing this may not be fully compatible with certain use cases, such as migration of a WordPress site from a web host that uses a recent PHP version to a different web host that uses PHP 5.2. These use cases are plausible (but very unlikely) based on statistics showing widespread deployment of WordPress with obsolete PHP versions.|October 19, 2017; 3:29:00 PM -0400|V3.0: 7.5 HIGH      V2.0: 5.0 MEDIUM (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?name=CVE-2012-6707&vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N&version=3.0&source=NIST)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2012-6707
CVE-2012-6708|jQuery before 1.9.0 is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The jQuery(strInput) function does not differentiate selectors from HTML in a reliable fashion. In vulnerable versions, jQuery determined whether the input was HTML by looking for the '<' character anywhere in the string, giving attackers more flexibility when attempting to construct a malicious payload. In fixed versions, jQuery only deems the input to be HTML if it explicitly starts with the '<' character, limiting exploitability only to attackers who can control the beginning of a string, which is far less common.|January 18, 2018; 6:29:00 PM -0500|V3.0: 6.1 MEDIUM      V2.0: 4.3 MEDIUM (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?name=CVE-2012-6708&vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N&version=3.0&source=NIST)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2012-6708
