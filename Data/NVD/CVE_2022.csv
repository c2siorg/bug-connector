The Ursa and AnonCreds CL-Signatures implementations always generate a sufficient private key. A malicious issuer could in theory create a custom CL Signature implementation (derived from the Ursa or AnonCreds CL-Signatures implementations) that uses weakened private keys such that presentations from holders could be shared by verifiers to the issuer who could determine the holder to which the credential was issued.

CVE-2022-34321|"Improper Authentication vulnerability in Apache Pulsar Proxy allows an attacker to connect to the /proxy-stats endpoint without authentication. The vulnerable endpoint exposes detailed statistics about live connections, along with the capability to modify the logging level of proxied connections without requiring proper authentication credentials.

This issue affects Apache Pulsar versions from 2.6.0 to 2.10.5, from 2.11.0 to 2.11.2, from 3.0.0 to 3.0.1, and 3.1.0.

The known risks include exposing sensitive information such as connected client IP and unauthorized logging level manipulation which could lead to a denial-of-service condition by significantly increasing the proxy's logging overhead. When deployed via the Apache Pulsar Helm chart within Kubernetes environments, the actual client IP might not be revealed through the load balancer's default behavior, which typically obscures the original source IP addresses when externalTrafficPolicy is being configured to ""Cluster"" by default. The /proxy-stats endpoint contains topic level statistics, however, in the default configuration, the topic level statistics aren't known to be exposed.

2.10 Pulsar Proxy users should upgrade to at least 2.10.6.
2.11 Pulsar Proxy users should upgrade to at least 2.11.3.
3.0 Pulsar Proxy users should upgrade to at least 3.0.2.
3.1 Pulsar Proxy users should upgrade to at least 3.1.1.

Users operating versions prior to those listed above should upgrade to the aforementioned patched versions or newer versions. Additionally, it's imperative to recognize that the Apache Pulsar Proxy is not intended for direct exposure to the internet. The architectural design of Pulsar Proxy assumes that it will operate within a secured network environment, safeguarded by appropriate perimeter defenses."|March 12, 2024; 3:15:47 PM -0400|V3.x:(not available) V2.0:(not available)  (None)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-34321

CVE-2022-4149|The Netskope client service (prior to R96) on Windows runs as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM which writes log files to a writable directory (C:\Users\Public\netSkope) for a standard user. The files are created and written with a SYSTEM account except one file (logplaceholder) which inherits permission giving all users full access control list. Netskope client restricts access to this file by allowing only read permissions as a standard user. Whenever the Netskope client service restarts, it deletes the logplaceholder and recreates, creating a race condition, which can be exploited by a malicious local user to create the file and set ACL permissions on the file. Once the file is created by a malicious user with proper ACL permissions, all files within C:\Users\Public\netSkope\ becomes modifiable by the unprivileged user.

CVE-2022-46337|"A cleverly devised username might bypass LDAP authentication checks. In 
LDAP-authenticated Derby installations, this could let an attacker fill 
up the disk by creating junk Derby databases. In LDAP-authenticated 
Derby installations, this could also allow the attacker to execute 
malware which was visible to and executable by the account which booted 
the Derby server. In LDAP-protected databases which weren't also 
protected by SQL GRANT/REVOKE authorization, this vulnerability could 
also let an attacker view and corrupt sensitive data and run sensitive 
database functions and procedures.

Mitigation:

Users should upgrade to Java 21 and Derby 10.17.1.0.

Alternatively, users who wish to remain on older Java versions should 
build their own Derby distribution from one of the release families to 
which the fix was backported: 10.16, 10.15, and 10.14. Those are the 
releases which correspond, respectively, with Java LTS versions 17, 11,

CVE-2022-46751|"Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference, XML Injection (aka Blind XPath Injection) vulnerability in Apache Software Foundation Apache Ivy.This issue affects any version of Apache Ivy prior to 2.5.2.

When Apache Ivy prior to 2.5.2 parses XML files - either its own configuration, Ivy files or Apache Maven POMs - it will allow downloading external document type definitions and expand any entity references contained therein when used.

This can be used to exfiltrate data, access resources only the machine running Ivy has access to or disturb the execution of Ivy in different ways.

Starting with Ivy 2.5.2 DTD processing is disabled by default except when parsing Maven POMs where the default is to allow DTD processing but only to include a DTD snippet shipping with Ivy that is needed to deal with existing Maven POMs that are not valid XML files but are nevertheless accepted by Maven. Access can be be made more lenient via newly introduced system properties where needed.

Users of Ivy prior to version 2.5.2 can use Java system properties to restrict processing of external DTDs, see the section about ""JAXP Properties for External Access restrictions"" inside Oracle's ""Java API for XML Processing (JAXP) Security Guide""."|August 21, 2023; 3:15:33 AM -0400|V3.1: 8.2 HIGHV2.0:(not available)  (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?name=CVE-2022-46751&vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:L&version=3.1&source=NIST)|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-46751

CVE-2022-48629|"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: qcom-rng - ensure buffer for generate is completely filled

The generate function in struct rng_alg expects that the destination
buffer is completely filled if the function returns 0. qcom_rng_read()
can run into a situation where the buffer is partially filled with
randomness and the remaining part of the buffer is zeroed since
qcom_rng_generate() doesn't check the return value. This issue can
be reproduced by running the following from libkcapi:

    kcapi-rng -b 9000000 > OUTFILE

The generated OUTFILE will have three huge sections that contain all
zeros, and this is caused by the code where the test
'val & PRNG_STATUS_DATA_AVAIL' fails.

Let's fix this issue by ensuring that qcom_rng_read() always returns
with a full buffer if the function returns success. Let's also have
qcom_rng_generate() return the correct value.

Here's some statistics from the ent project
(https://www.fourmilab.ch/random/) that shows information about the
quality of the generated numbers:

    Total:       9000000   1.000000

    Entropy = 7.811590 bits per byte.

    Optimum compression would reduce the size
    of this 9000000 byte file by 2 percent.

    Chi square distribution for 9000000 samples is 9329962.81, and
    randomly would exceed this value less than 0.01 percent of the
    times.

    Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 119.3731 (127.5 = random).
    Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.197293333 (error 1.77 percent).
    Serial correlation coefficient is 0.159130 (totally uncorrelated =
    0.0).

Without this patch, the results of the chi-square test is 0.01%, and
the numbers are certainly not random according to ent's project page.
The results improve with this patch:
