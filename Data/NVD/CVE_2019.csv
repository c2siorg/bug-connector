There are two array out-of-bounds memory accesses, one in

errors are embarassingly simple, and the fixes are straightforward.

you'll want to apply the netlbl_bitmap_walk() patch to

NOTE: the vendor's position is that this behavior was introduced intentionally, and cannot be removed without breaking backwards compatibility (some users may be relying on these values).
