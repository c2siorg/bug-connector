This fixes t/security/CVE-2009-3555.t where
has_buffered_data() doesn't help, because it
finds the buffered data and doesn't call
SSL_read(), so the reneg handshake isn't
triggered. SSL_peek() for 0 bytes seems to
reliably trigger the reneg in every case.

No more polling/sleeping. The code for the
OpenSSL 1.1.0 case is now again very close to
the pre 1.1.0 case.

Still need to run the full test suite with a
clean build.

commit,4cf751dbb992d73c70687e93ba38335121c4194b,"Fix closing the back end connection in case of error.
The field ""closed"" was changed from an int to a bit
field of size one in 2.4.x.
For historical reasons a close instruction was coded
as an increment on the field, which in 2.4.x flips
the field each time. There were mutliple code paths
that would flip it several times for a single error,
so effectively the connection was no longer closed
in these cases.

Especially in the case of an aborted client connection
this lead to a non consumed back end buffer and thus to
response mixup between users.
